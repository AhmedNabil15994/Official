# WA API

An implementation of [@adiwajshing/Baileys](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys) as a simple RESTful API service with multiple device support. This project implements both **Legacy** (Normal WhatsApp Web) and **Beta Multi-Device** client so that you can choose and use one of them easily.

## Requirements

-   **NodeJS** version **14.5.0** or higher.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Enter to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies.

## `.env` Configurations

```env
# Listening Host
HOST=127.0.0.1

# Listening Port
PORT=8000

# Maximum Reconnect Attempts
MAX_RETRIES=5

# Reconnect Interval (in Milliseconds)
RECONNECT_INTERVAL=5000
```

## Usage

1. You can start the app by executing `npm run start` or `node .`.
2. Now the endpoint should be available according to your environment variable configurations. Default is at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Docs

The API documentation is available online [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/9fecbd2eff8fbdf2fb45). You can also import the **Postman Collection File** `(postman_collection.json)` into your Postman App alternatively.

The server will respond in following JSON format:

```javascript
{
    success: true|false, // bool
    message: "", // string
    data: {}|[] // object or array of object
}
```
